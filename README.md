## Project Scope
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for me to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

## Techniques
In this assignment I used a variety of different techniques to analyze the data. The following is the workflow I used:

- Step 1: Gathering data
- Step 2: Assessing data
- Step 3: Cleaning data
- Step 4: Storing data
- Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data
- Step 6: Reporting

## Analysis
In my analysis, we analyzed the WeRateDogs twitter account tweets between Nobember 11th, 2015 to August 1st, 2017. The analysis was based on my own curiosity within the data and the three questions I asked were:
1. What is the most common dog name?
2. What are the monthly tweet trends with the WeRateDogs Posts?
3. What are the trends with the WeRateDogs Posts (overall number of tweets)?
